      <h2>Vehicle Data</h2>
      <h3>Speed</h3>
      <p>The speed of the vehicle can be obtained from the vehicle's onboard diagnostics (OBD) system or other speed sensors. This data is crucial for monitoring vehicle performance and ensuring safe driving conditions. Speed data helps in assessing the vehicle's adherence to speed limits, optimizing fuel efficiency, and enhancing overall safety.</p>
      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>The location of the vehicle can be acquired through GPS data from the vehicle's navigation system or a connected device. This data helps in tracking the vehicle's current position and route. Accurate location data is essential for navigation, route planning, and emergency response in case of breakdowns or accidents.</p>
      <h3>Status</h3>
      <p>The status of the vehicle can be determined from various sensors and onboard systems, indicating whether the vehicle is in motion, parked, or experiencing a fault. This information is essential for vehicle diagnostics and maintenance. Knowing the vehicle's status helps in scheduling maintenance, identifying potential issues, and ensuring the vehicle is operating within safe parameters.<br>

      <h2>Sensor Data</h2>
      <h3>Camera</h3>
      <p>The status of the vehicle's camera system, whether it is active or inactive, can be obtained from the vehicle's sensor management system. Cameras are used for various applications, including lane keeping, traffic sign recognition, and collision avoidance. Monitoring the camera status ensures that these critical safety features are functioning correctly.</p>
      <h3>Lidar</h3>
      <p>The status of the Lidar sensor, indicating its operational state, can be monitored through the vehicle's sensor interface. Lidar sensors provide detailed 3D maps of the vehicle's surroundings, aiding in navigation and obstacle detection. Ensuring the Lidar sensor is active is crucial for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).</p>
      <h3>Radar</h3>
      <p>The operational status of the Radar sensor can be checked via the vehicle's onboard sensor network. Radar sensors detect the speed and distance of objects, playing a vital role in adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance systems. Keeping the Radar sensor functional is essential for maintaining safe distances from other vehicles and objects on the road.<br>

      <h2>Traffic Information</h2>
      <h3>Traffic Status</h3>
      <p>Information on current traffic conditions can be gathered from traffic monitoring systems, navigation apps, or smart city infrastructure. This data helps in route planning and avoiding congested roads. Knowing the traffic status enables drivers to choose the most efficient routes, saving time and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
      <h3>Congestion Level</h3>
      <p>The level of traffic congestion can be estimated based on real-time traffic data from various sources such as traffic cameras and sensors. This information is useful for predicting travel times and optimizing routes. Understanding congestion levels allows for better planning of departure times and avoiding heavily congested areas.

      <h2>Weather Updates</h2>
      <h3>Temperature</h3>
      <p>The current temperature can be obtained from weather APIs or onboard weather sensors. Temperature data is important for understanding driving conditions and vehicle performance. Extreme temperatures can affect tire pressure, battery life, and overall vehicle performance.</p>
      <h3>Condition</h3>
      <p>The overall weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy) can be acquired from weather services or vehicle sensors. Weather conditions impact driving safety and vehicle handling. Knowing the weather conditions helps in adjusting driving behavior, such as reducing speed in rain or snow, and ensuring the vehicle is prepared for adverse conditions.
